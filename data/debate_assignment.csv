2,#current i think the 'mcC is right on...' by O is a good thing in itself, ofcourse each candidate has good points. not tactical, but true.
2,Great to see so many people engaged in the debates and election; regardless of party affiliation or candidate of choice.  #current
2,I think saying, "John is correct about..." along with "John, that's just not true." worked.  Obama seemed like the one in charge. #current
2,#debate08 @JohnMcCain has 954 Twitter Followers. @BarackObama has 86,312. Looks like @BarackObama won Twitter by a landslide.

2,@stevenbjohnson he said "don't torture... ever again." pretty clearly. #debate08
2,@janoss - re: emotive - neither candidate has it, but I met Obama in Chicago...so I'm biased. Obama likes to meet eye-to-eye.
2,CNN played Kissinger's response proving McCains answer correct. #debate08

2,@janoss - So, IMO, Obama won in his eye-to-eye, direct points, and his mission. The differences were very clear tonight.

3,#debate08 Obama has the facts and vision, McCain has the catch phrases and blind single-mindedness to win this. Obama is missing the point
3,My Totals (and I'm a Democrat): McCain 12, Obama 6 -- Obama has a lot of work ahead of himself. #tweetdebate
3,#debate08 #current  Bill Kristol Maybe Obama won the first round but McCain won every other round.  Obama on the defensive.
3,I'm not buying the McCain win on FP. I think Obama is *right* about Afghanistan and Pakistan re Al Qaeda - #debate08
3,Yup.  Obama is the intellectuallay generous guy.  Too bad the American public would rather vote for the biggest dick. #current
3,@SarahInMI I am on Fox- I know someone in Az who might be on the local fox news there and she thinks it might be put in a national feed
3,#current is off the chain. Loving the comments and opinions of the masses.
3,Bill Bennett: How many times did Obama say "John is right" and how many times did McCain say "Obama is wrong"? #debate08 #current
3,Verdict: McCain exceeded all expectations.  BHO: flat.  #current #debate
3,#current Bill Bennett says Obama is "intellectually generous guy" but McCain was the "sherriff" and "masterful" cause he "knew the names."
3,Bill Bennett is right, McCain was firmer. More conviction. Good grasp of facts and figures. Obama tried to reframe things too much. #current
3,As angry as I got at McCain for his petty BS (ignoring Obama the whole time), it was a pretty even debate. Nice and unfriendly.  #debate08
3,Last year these debates used to be special, but with all those primary debates, this seems so regular to me #current #debate08
3,You don't "win" a debate in general unless you knock it out of the park. #current
3,Does Obama have to be on the attack to win a debate? I thought was he appropriate w/ shots but some think he wasn't tough enough? #debate08
3,#debate08 join the covert radio show forums to talk about the war on terror and security. http://is.gd/3chp
3,#debate08 Obama 1, McCain 0
3,#debate08 It did seem like Obama was constant agreeing with McCain.  McCain, however, not so nice.
3,@POttenhoff "JM needs to step up policy distinctions." Obama was agreeing with McCain time and again. #debate08 #current
3,McCain did well in the beginning, but Obama took over once foreign policy kicked in. #debate08
3,McCain looked better on a narrow set of issues; Obama looked more consistent across the board but didn't win big.  Close. #tweetdebate
3,#debate08 I think you have to give a slight edge to Obama, if for no other reason than McCain's "Don't Understand/Reagan" tired offense
3,a little brain numb from watching debate. I thought McCain did well at times. Obama-too much agreeing. #debate08
3,#debate08 Obama actually talked about the present...mccain just told a bunch stories.  Obama 1, McCain 0
3,#debate08 Well, it's clear Obama won on policy and principle, but McCain may have won on sound bites. Obama was too polite!
3,Twitter and #current debate very cool, would have been better if I bypassed sucky current signal and went straight to web. All and all A+
3,Katie, you're beautiful...but Wrong!#current
3,@FakeObama08 Kind of makes you long for the days when President Roosevelt just got on TV and told you what was going on...no sugar coating!
3,#current Now Guilliani on NBC. He laughs...ha, ha, ha... when Brian Williams says Biden called McCain "wrong" about Iraq.
3,Uhh. Palin didn't give a response to the media when Biden did? That really doesn't look good. #debate08
3,"Barack Obama doesn't understand" and "I agree with John McCain" were the major repeated lines of the night -Cameron #debate08 #current
3,#debate08 mccain wins on passion. obama's 1, 2, 3ing was stilted. mccain sought to convince, obama was presenting logic.
3,#debate08 Acknowledging common ground with your opponent is not weakness.
3,Biden will step up to the plate and talk about the debate to Brian Williams, but where's Palin...? Oh, that's right, too cowardly #current
3,@Condoulo yes I like those Clinton policies, but you have yet to say what he actually did.
3,How can Obama bring up Palin ?  If he can, without looking mean, he can win #current #debate08
3,#current Ooh, the RNC spin: "Obama says we have to lose in Iraq in order to win in Afghanistan." according to Guilianni.
3,Loved that fact that Obama said McCain was correct so many times and McCain said Obama was clueless about issues #current #debate08
3,I want to see Obama more aggressive in the next debate. I know he has more of a fight in him. #current
3,Good point from a FOX News commentator: McCain's looking backward, Obama is looking forward. #current
3,Post #debate08 Senator Biden appears on NBC, Gov. Palin absent and Rudi Giullianni is filling in for her...strange indeed.
3,Obama said "John is right" at least 8 times! McCain on offense,Obama on defense. 21 Factcheck for BHO 16 for McCain #comment #debate08
3,obama wasn't concise enough and should've pushed 3rd bush term more, but he looked like a plausible CiC, which was top priority #tweetdebate
3,NPR Commentary: "A stalemate is a win for Obama as this is McCain's strongest point." ha.  Hadn't thought of it that way. #debate08
3,#debate08 #current On a recent falling out w/Ron Paul Barr:"We wanted to provide true focused leadership for the L.P." "R.P. did espouse"
3,#debate08 Obama appeared presidential vs McCain who acted liked a cranky old grandpa
3,#debate08 were was the spice? I expected more wrangling. None scripted.
3,#debate08 also, giulani is miles left (not nearly left enough though) of palin on almost every issue
3,#current #debate08 Neither did too great. Now the news bias spins off...Fox: McCain grand slam. CNN seems pretty even for now.
3,I would say it was 50/50 #debate08
3,notice that McCain didn't mention education, his healthcare plan other than keeping it private and taking care of nations children #current
3,: #debate08 Neither of them "won." Obama held his own, but was often defensive against McCain's digs. McCain swung from grumpy to bland.
3,#winner #current The debate result is much like how the poll results have been: somewhat close, leaning toward whichever guy you like.
3,giuliani lies. Obama will cut corporate loopholes. better plan than raising my taxes.  #debate08
3,obama may not have the experience mccain has, he does imho  have a plausible theory of what american foreign policy should be about #current
3,@current pavlicko Obama wasn't the one that almost didn't show up.
3,McCain did better than I thought he would tonight, but he did lie several times and his economic policy is ridiculous, now the VPs #debate08
3,McCain headed back to DC #current #debate
3,One thing that Obama had over McCain is that he turned and tried to engage McCain, McCain avoided all eye contact #current #tweetdebate
3,MCCAIN: How about a spending freeze on everything but defense, veteran affairs and entitlement programs. #DEBATE08
3,Most common statments tonight: Obama: "McCain is right"; McCain: "Obama doesn't understand". Points to McCain. #current
3,The transcripts are up people, let's get the facts straight and not add to the spin #DEBATE08
3,#current Both candidates gave very convincing party lines, but chats on Sun Times chat reveals Obama favored...McCain viewed as nervous
3,#debate08 OBAMA won!!! McCain looked like a condescending old man tonight!
3,#current Obama sounds better on the stump than in the debate
3,#current - visually, McCain won hands down.  You don't  put a dark-skinned person against a blue background, and you turn the lights up.
3,No matter who wins, we're headed for tough times. #tweetdebate
3,Nice that McCain tried to lead on Obama and he wouldnt take the bait. #debate08
3,Obama showed that he's calm under pressure, while McCain showed that he can't treat dissent as intelligent or reasoned.Obama wins! #debate08
3,@janoss - not once. Obama looked at McCain numerous times, addressed him directly at least nine times.
3,After the debates, Obama: Gentleman. McCain: A-hole. #current
3,Obama got away with pretending to be a sober, sensible centrist instead of the statist he is, and thus won the debate #debate08
3,#current McCain came off as the cranky, old man he is...er, old, white-haired dude
3,I wonder how long it will take the McSame camp to roll out their "John is right" Obama debate quote commercials? #debate08 #current
3,Obama=New Media King; all hype. McCain's team has been pumping out YouTube ads w HUGE off-line impact. Ie: http://snurl.com/3vlxx #debate08
3,#current #debate08 McCain didn't get very high highs, but his ratings with Independents looked fairly strong throughout, especially on #pork
3,@benpolitico Just saw you on CNN walking past Dana Bash and Nicole Wallace. #debate08 #current
3,@ButtaBaby they already have ads saying "McCain won!" #current
3,#current  Wow, the media works fast. http://tinyurl.com/43n74w hahaha.epic.
3,McCain already has an ad out from the debates. Damn that was fast http://tinyurl.com/49unmh #current
3,#debate08 I think it was a draw... maybe McCain a bit up but this is his issue!
3,#debate08 Obama said "McCain was right" eight times! McCain never spelled out that he agreed with Obama
3,And for all of you tweeters twittering over McCain's "Existential Threat" that was no error; literally: "A threat to existence" #current
3,#debate08 1st debate done & i still don't think i'm leaning either way. finger pointing & 1/2 truths on both sides. not much honesty imho
3,@janoss - Obama =total control over emotive... typical Lyndon Johnson "socialist." At the same time- I wonder how he won over "experience."
3,@tarheelcoxn re: earmarks, obama could've just asked him why he picked palin with all of hers. #debate08
3,#current Biden: What're ya gonna do economically and relative to the war? That's what it's all about.
3,@janoss - I would expect Obama to represent this country with dignity. Not so with McCain/Palin
3,#current Biden: Obama said in order to get economy moving again, you gotta help middle class. McCain wants to help out the billionaires.
3,@DocMara hopefully the GOP will select someone younger and eloquent vs Obama in 2012. I'd like to see that debate. #debate08
3,btw: ted kennedy is ok. #debate08 #current
3,@EndTheRoboCalls Veeps go at it 10/2 #debate08
3,@problogger A draw. #debate 08 #tweetdebate
3,20% McCain;  75% Obama; remaining not sure-- predicted winner of debate according to MSNBC voters #current #tweetdebate
3,@Imarilove exploiting is what he knows and loves, methinks
3,#debate08 other big question: did McCain acknowledge that the US has tortured people in recent years? If so, that's major story....
3,#current Anderson to Wolf "don't hold your breath waiting for Palin to comment tonight" (laughter all around)
3,#debate08 my feelings are pretty much this... why JUST those two canidates? I thought there were more than two???
3,@cyn3matic McCain's tie looks fine in HD, but I hear it was aliasing like crazy on SD channels. #debate08
3,@Imarilove Yes!!! Obama has done more for veterans than McCain has DESPITE the fact that McCain's a former POW.
3,#debate08 biden/palin debate viewship will trump this one. Great odds biden gaffes like never before, or palin completely melts down
3,@etherkiller and when Obama tried to set his own record straight, McCain talked over him. Obama was the better man and stood down. #debate08
3,#debate08 some undecided woman on cnn just said that obama didn't stutter. maybe she wasn't watching the same debate i was...
3,In case anyone cares, Henry Kissinger just released a statement noting that Obama just doesn't know anything.  #current #debate08
3,@freeulysses that's what we do best... irrationallity #debate08
3,#2019 #current in other words those without a pick best understood the heart of the issues, but had little voice over the rally cries.
3,@korym I hope an iPhone will solve this issue. ;) Also: #debate08 is basically either 'OBAMA RAWK' or 'MCCAIN'S NEW AD: url'. Laaame.
3,McCain wasn't bad but he was attacking Obama more than actually taking a stand. Obama's positions became more clear.  Good #debate08
3,#2019 #current looking back on it now, I can't say that it made much of a difference to us now, unless the other guy cut GEAS funding.
3,Obama: McCain you're right.  McCain: Senator Obama just doesn't understand #current #debate08
3,#debate08 It scares me that people being polled still think McCain is better on military/veteran issues. Support the troops -- vote Obama!
3,you have to be a fast reader at http://election.twitter.com/ #debate08
3,#debate08, Obama will let anyone talk over top of him. Not very macho. McCain will kick ass & talk over top of all peoples/nations RNCFTW
3,#debate08 wtf is this McCain twitter banner next to barack's banner? http://twitter.com/JohnMcCain. Fake JM?!?
3,#debate08 Who won? It depends on the topic. McCain good on foreign policy. Obama on home turf/leadership. Looking for fact checks.
3,Collected my thoughts and I think mcain would do some stuff well. But Obama would do more, better. #current night
3,Joe Biden just dropped a brute steamer on McCain's face on MSNBC #debate08
3,@RobertBluey Well, then McCain needs to prove that he's head and shoulders above Obama on policy - Are you saying BO rope-a-doped?
3,y say its ok to 'tie' bc its the other guy's strength? foreign policy is NOT mccain's strength. why do we keep giving them ground? #debate08
